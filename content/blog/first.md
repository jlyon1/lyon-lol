I intend to start casually blogging here to keep me on track with my goals and to satiate people's desire to add blogs to their RSS readers. I plan to very casually write about the projects I am working on or just write my thoughts in a more long-form format to improve my writing and communication skills. This is moving very slowly, but it is moving. To kick things off...

I am making an effort to contribute more to the Projects I use regularly, and just putting the crappy prototypes out there. I often find I'm limiting myself by thinking that I shouldn't bother doing something because no one will use it or that it's already been done better than I can. I have found this has hindered my progress or willingness to work on things I want to in multiple ways. 

Most Recently...

* [Proto](github.com/jlyon1/proto) - A WIP command line tool to manage protobufs and eventually deploy them to a PaaS platform.
* [GRPC-Kotlin Bazel Build Windows](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin/pull/375) - An upstream contribution to support building GRPC-Kotlin on windows using Bazel.

I'm in between Github Profiles at the moment so my contributions are split between [@jlyon12345](https://github.com/jlyon12345) and [@jlyon1](https://github.com/jlyon1).
