<h2>About</h2>
<p class="text">I am a software engineer based in New York City. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work in a diverse range of industries, including finance, ad tech, and video games. I am deeply committed to ensuring that my work is of the high quality, and I take great care to pay close attention to the detail.</p>
<p class="text">My most recent experience includes working at Bloomberg, where I contributed to the development of trading automation systems. The projects I worked on there were challenging, but I was able to apply my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to deliver results that exceeded expectations. Now I work at Wolfjaw Studios, a leading video game development company. There, I collaborate with a talented team of developers to bring exciting new games to life.</p>
