      <p>I have recently been reading &quot;Think Again&quot; by Adam Grant. One of the topics he talks about is Relationship Conflict (more interpersonal conflict, &quot;I don't like this person&quot;) vs. Task Conflict (conflict about solving the problem at hand). Focus your team's conflicts on the tasks at hand vs. interpersonal conflicts and fundamental identity-based disagreements. This idea resonated with me, and I recognized this concept immediately as a principle I developed in my work without realizing it. It's a skill that I hope to cultivate more deliberately going forward.</p>
<p>Focusing on Task Conflict and avoiding Relationship Conflict is something I can admit I've performed poorly at in the past. I have found that sometimes it's hard to detach yourself from your ideas, making it easy to fall into the trap of being personally attached to your idea, resulting in a worse conflict. I can vividly remember a time in college while working on the <a href="https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker">Shuttle Tracker</a>, when I found myself getting worked up over a code review. I was taking what was constructive criticism personally. Admittedly, I was new to the language and web development then, and I knew my code was not up to par. Looking back on this, I cringe at my behavior. I was in a Relationship Conflict mode-my identity was being attacked when I should have been in Task Conflict mode. Once I learned to let go of my attachment to specific details, I could take an analytical look at my solution and start to learn how to improve. Once I let go, I could utilize my colleagues' reviews to learn different perspectives, ideas, and strategies for developing software.
I eventually came to realize often, in software, There is no &quot;right way,&quot; and learning how other people solve a specific problem has given me an appreciation for the focus and drive that others put into their work, even if they don't do things the way I would have.</p>
<p>As my career and open-source contributions developed, I learned to detach from the specific implementation and ideas while focusing on the overarching task. After I learned to do this, I made significant strides in my abilities as a software engineer and learned and adapted to new roles. Now I try to keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strive for a solution (hopefully the best solution). Not necessarily your solution. Look at all solutions as objectively as possible.</li>
<li>Teams can only effectively work together when they can discuss tasks with each other and disagree on implementation. </li>
<li>Hurt feelings have no place in software development. </li>
<li>Striking the right balance here is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: very real interpersonal conflict issues can crop up, but here we are focusing solely on engineering problems. </p>
<p>Cultivating a task-based culture is crucial to working collaboratively and building an effective team culture. This Task Conflict style only works if everyone buys in. I have tried to bring this attitude to the table when joining a new team as an IC and found it can be infectious. I have done this through very explicit communication about the fact that I am focusing on the task, not the implementation.  I do this on teams that I'm on by coming into every conversation about a code review and framing my suggestions as us working together to find the best solution. </p>
<p>This works best for me if I can incorporate people's solutions into my suggestions. Highlight the areas where they did well and frame suggestions as questions to build a better product. For example: &quot;This solution is great; I like how you structured the data here; what do you think about leveraging that data structure more cleanly with a map-reduce instead of a for loop.&quot; By explicitly communicating your common goal repeatedly and often, you can direct focus toward that goal. It helps keep the team focused on the bigger picture during these discussions.</p>
<p>Going forward, I plan to define better how to maintain this team culture and keep everyone focused on a common goal.</p>
