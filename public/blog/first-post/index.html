  Another Software Engineer With a Blog
</h2>
<p class="subtitle"><light>2023-02-12</light></p>
<p>I intend to start casually blogging here to keep me on track with my goals and to satiate people's desire to add blogs to their RSS readers. I plan to very casually write about the projects I am working on or just write my thoughts in a more long-form format to improve my writing and communication skills. This is moving very slowly, but it is moving. To kick things off...</p>
<p>I am making an effort to contribute more to the Projects I use regularly, and just putting the crappy prototypes out there. I often find I'm limiting myself by thinking that I shouldn't bother doing something because no one will use it or that it's already been done better than I can. I have found this has hindered my progress or willingness to work on things I want to in multiple ways. </p>
<p>Most Recently...</p>

<li><a href="https://lyon.lol/blog/first-post/github.com/jlyon1/proto">Proto</a> - A WIP command line tool to manage protobufs and eventually deploy them to a PaaS platform.</li>

<p>I'm in between Github Profiles at the moment so my contributions are split between <a href="https://github.com/jlyon12345">@jlyon12345</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jlyon1">@jlyon1</a>.</p>
