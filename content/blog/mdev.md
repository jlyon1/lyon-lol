## Summary:
In this talk, we explore the development of Catena, a set of tools for building scalable and low-cost backend systems designed specifically for multiplayer games. By simplifying API design and drawing inspiration from established game engines, Catena provides user-friendly, flexible solutions for server and match management. We'll discuss the challenges of adapting Big Tech infrastructure like Kubernetes for game servers, and how our unique approach to matchmaker and fleet management focuses on developer experience and usability.
